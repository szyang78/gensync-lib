# GenSync-lib

GenSync-lib is the version for packaging. It provides a library for synchronizing data _efficiently_ across different machines on MacOS and Linux.  The library
includes implmenetations of several state-of-the-art protocols that optimize different metrics, including:
* ___Communication___ - total number of bytes transmitted
* ___Rounds___ - the amount of back-and-forth needed to compelte synchronization
* ___Computation___ - computing resources required
* ___Memory___ - amount of physical memory needed

The current version is 2.0.4

## Extended Use Instructions:
- *Include Statements:* `#include <GenSync/(Aux/Data/Communicants/Syncs)/(The module you want to use)>`

1. Initialize a `GenSync` object with the constructor or builder helper class on the client and server machine

   ```cpp
       GenSync::Builder builder = GenSync::Builder().
          setProtocol(GenSync::SyncProtocol::GenSync).  //GenSync,InterCPISync, ProbCPISync, IBLTSync, FullSync, etc.
          setComm(GenSync::SyncComm::socket). //CommSocket or CommString
          setPort(8001).
          setHost(localhost).
       
          //Set the parameters for your specific sync type (Not the same for every protocol. See GenSync build parameters section)
          setBits(64). // Bits per element
          setMbar(256). // Max differences to sync
          setErr(7); // -log_2(prob of error) to allow for errors that might otherwise underflow
          
       GenSync mySyncClientOrServer = builder.build();
   ```

2. Add elements to your GenSyncs (If you need to add large elements use the ZZ class from NTL)
    * You may manually create a shared_ptr<DataObject> (Data/DataObject.h) or pass a data type compatible with DataObject and one will be automatically created for you, returning a pointer to the newly created DataObject
   ```cpp
       mySyncClientOrServer.addElem(myZZ);
       mySyncClientOrServer.addElem(myLong);
       mySyncClientOrServer.addElem(myInt);
       mySyncClientOrServer.addElem(myMultiSet); // Multisets are serialized for use in IBLTSetOfSets. This does NOT add each element in the multiset to your sync.
   ```


3. Run serverSyncBegin and clientSyncBegin on the server and client respectively
   ```cpp
       mySyncServer.serverSyncBegin(0); //Add the index of the sync you would like to perform
       mySyncClient.clientSyncBegin(0);  //Multiple syncs or communicants may be added to one GenSync
   ```

4. Collect relevant statistics
   ```cpp
      //The sync index is decided by the order you added your sync in
      //If your GenSync has only 1 sync the index is 0
       mySyncClient.printStats(syncIndex); //Returns a string of formatted stats about your sync
       mySyncClient.mySyncVec[syncIndex]->getName(); //Retruns the name and parameters for your sync
       mySyncClient.getXmitBytes(syncIndex); //Returns the number of bytes transmitted by this sync
       mySyncClient.getRecvBytes(syncIndex); //Returns the number of bytes received by this sync
       mySyncClient.getCommTime(syncIndex); //Returns the amount of time in seconds that the sync spent sending and receiving info through a socket
       mySyncClient.getIdleTime(syncIndex); //The amount of time spent waiting for a connection or for a peer to finish computation
       mySyncClient.getCompTime(syncIndex); //The amount of time spent doing computations

       
   ```

### Sync Types:
* **Included Sync Protocols (Sets and Multisets):**
    * CPISync
        * Sync using the protocol described [here](http://ipsit.bu.edu/documents/ieee-it3-web.pdf). The maximum number of differences that can be reconciled must be bounded by setting mBar. The server does the necessary computations while the client waits, and returns the required values to the client
    * CPISync_OneLessRound
        * Perform CPISync with set elements represented in full in order to reduce the amount of rounds of communication by one (No hash inverse round of communication). The server does the necessary computations while the client waits, and returns the required values to the client
    * OneWayCPISync
        * Perform CPISync in one direction, only adding new elements from the client to the server. The client's elements are not updated. The server does the necessary computations and determines what elements they need to add to their set. The client does not receive a return message and does not have their elements updated
    * ProbCPISync
        * Perform CPISync with a given mBar but if the amount of differences is larger than that, double mBar until the sync is successful. The server does the necessary computations while the client waits, and returns the required values to the client
    * InteractiveCPISync
        * Perform CPISync but if there are more than mBar differences, divide the set into `numPartitions` subsets and attempt to CPISync again. This recurses until the sync is successful. The server does the necessary computations while the client waits, and returns the required values to the client
    * FullSync
        * The client sends the server its set contents and the server determines what elements it needs from the clients set. The server also determines what elements the client needs and sends them back.
    * IBLTSync
        * Each peer encodes their set into an [Invertible Bloom Lookup Table](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.2245.pdf) with a size determined by NumExpElements and the client sends their IBLT to their per. The differences are determined by "subtracting" the IBLT's from each other and attempting to peel the resulting IBLT. The server peer then returns the elements that the client peer needs to update their set
    * OneWayIBLTSync
        * The client sends their IBLT to their server peer and the server determines what elements they need to add to their set. The client does not receive a return message and does not update their set
    * CuckooSync
        * Each peer encodes their set into a [cuckoo filter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf). Peers exchange their cuckoo filters. Each host infers the elements that are not in its peer by looking them up in the peer's cuckoo filter. Any elements that are not found in the peer's cuckoo filter are sent to it.
* **Included Sync Protocols (Set of Sets):**
    * IBLT Set of Sets
        * Sync using the protocol described [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3196959.3196988). This sync serializes an IBLT containing a child set into a bitstring where it is then treated as an element of a larger IBLT. Each host recovers the IBLT containing the serialized IBLTs and deserializes each one. A matching procedure is then used to determine which child sets should sync with each other and which elements they need. If this sync is two way this info is then sent back to the peer node. The number of differences in each child IBLT may not be larger than the total number of sets being synced
